# Microbiome-Workshop-2024

Workshop Description: Are you intrigued by microbiome research but feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the analyses? This workshop is designed to break down the "black box" of microbiome analysis and provide students and trainees with a solid foundation to confidently explore microbial community data. 

Led by Sterling Wright, a post doc at Arizona State University, this hands-on session will guide participants through the essential concepts, tools, and workflows for microbiome analysis. Whether you are new to the field or looking to refine your skills, this workshop will provide a clear roadmap for navigating microbiome research. 

## What you will learn: 
Key steps in microbiome research: From experimental design to data processing, learen the foundational steps for analyzing microbial communities. 
Understanding analyses: Explore concepts like compositionality, beta diversity, and differential abundance analysis. 
Hands-On with Bioinformatic tools: Work with tools such as seqkit, fastqc, QIIME2 and DADA2

## Format: 
This workshop will include a lecture covering the key concepts in microbiome research with hands-on exercises using real microbiome data. Participants will leave with practical skills and a clear understanding of how to apply microbiome analysis tools to their own research.
