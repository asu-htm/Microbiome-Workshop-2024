# Contains outputs generated from the analyses

In this directory, you will find the qzv files (QIIME2 visualizations) that can be uploaded to QIIME2 view (https://view.qiime2.org/). You will also find some of the images that were generated from the analyses. I recommend you trying to generate them youself, but these are provided so that you can assess whether you were able to replicate the results.
