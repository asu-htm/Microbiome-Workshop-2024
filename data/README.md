This directory contains the data for the workshop. Please download and copy to your home folder on Sol prior to the workshop. Because the data can be quite large, I subsampled the data to ensure that things run efficiently. However, if you are interested in downloading the complete dataset and running everything on your own, I have included the SRA accession numbers in the complete-data folder. 

The data comes from a study (Buetas et al. 2024) investigating the effect of periodontitis on the oral and intestinal microbiota. The design of the experiment used the 27F and 1492 R universal primer set. The KAPA HiFi Hot Start DNA Polymerase (KAPA Biosystems) was used and amplification of full-length 16S Gene with Barcoded Primers of Multiplexed SMRTbell Library Preparation and sequencing protocol was employed (Part Number 101-599-700 Version 04, PACBIO).
